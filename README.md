# LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications that are powered by Large Language Models like GPT, LLAMA2, PALM-2, among others.

This repository contains resources and materials for the first steps with LangChain and to provide hands-on experience with the different capabilities that the library offers.

### Sections (WIP)
1) Model IO: Understand the input and output mechanisms for effective communication with LLMs.
2) Data Connections: How to establish and manage connections with external data sources.
3) Chains: The concept of Chains and their role in structuring applications.
4) Memory: Storing and retrieving information.
5) Agents: Development of applications with LLMs.
