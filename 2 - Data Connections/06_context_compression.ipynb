Also published were seven volumes of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.Before the release of the final report, the committee also published an interim report titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders\", which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Gen. René Schneider of Chile and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed, and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan\\'s Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.\\nIn addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled \"Covert Action in Chile: 1963–1973\". The rest were kept secret at CIA\\'s request.According to a declassified National Security Agency history, the Church Committee also helped to uncover the NSA\\'s Watch List. The information for the list was compiled into the so-called \"Rhyming Dictionary\" of biographical information, which at its peak held millions of names—thousands of which were US citizens. Some prominent members of this list were Joanne Woodward, Thomas Watson, Walter Mondale, Art Buchwald, Arthur F. Burns, Gregory Peck, Otis G.

Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the \"family jewels\". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.The creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.', metadata={'title': 'Church Committee', 'summary': 'The Church Committee (formally the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) was a US Senate select committee in 1975 that  investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
